# Field log

Running notes from live sweeps, written as they come in from the floor and
kept next to the code rather than in a chat transcript. Each entry: what the
operator saw, what it turned out to be, what shipped. When a day's worth
accumulates it becomes the next addendum, so the drafting is already done.

Format is deliberately plain: symptom first, in the operator's words, because
the diagnosis is often wrong the first time and the symptom is what survives.

## Ship manifest

Fixes are batched rather than pushed one at a time, so a sweep is never
interrupted by a reload. This is the list to execute against.

**Live on main: v27.** What the phone is running right now.

**Queued on `claude/new-session-ri155r`, tested, not live:**

| | change | entry |
|---|---|---|
| v28 | traffic light on the big button — green stab, red wait | 9/10 #1 |
| v28 | a wet probe clears `hold`, so mid-bag stabs stop being dropped | 9/10 #2 |

**Known cost of waiting:** v27 still drops a mid-bag reading when the move
from reference to mid-bag is fast enough that the probe never reads under
3.5% in between. Until v28 ships, a beat's pause before the second stab
avoids it, and a room that will not finish is the tell that it happened.

**Not yet actioned** — nothing outstanding.

## 9/10/2026 — first morning on v27

### 1. The colour scheme reads as ambiguous mid-walk → v28

**Observed.** "The colour scheme is confusing me. I think we need to go back to
a more basic colour scheme of red means bad, green means good. While it's
doing its reading it should be red; while I can move the probe it should be
green. That should have me having fewer misstabs due to moving from the
reference to the midpoint stab too quickly."

**What it was.** v27 shipped Addendum A §1.3 literally: amber-pulsing for
ready, grey for logged. Two states, both muted, and the distinction that
actually matters while walking — *may I put the probe in a bag right now* —
was not the one the colours encoded.

**Shipped.** The button is a traffic light answering that one question.
GREEN pulsing: clear and armed, stab now. RED: do not stab, it is either
reading or logged and still in the bag. Amber is left to the pre-flight
states (connecting, checking the probe), which are neither. Labels carry the
detail: READING… HOLD STILL, LOGGED · PULL PROBE, STAB NOW.

Note that red now appears on the button as a routine state while it is also
the zero-EC alarm colour. The alarm is a separate held banner at the top of
the screen with its own tone and an acknowledge button, so position and
persistence still separate them — but if it reads ambiguously in the room,
say so and the alarm moves to another treatment.

### 2. A room would not finish — same bug as 1

**Observed.** "I finished the room and it's just continuing. It should have
thrown up the finished screen, and instead we started moving backwards on
table twelve. But we're still on table twelve, it's asking me for front
reference."

**What it was.** Not a route bug and not the cursor moving backwards — the
app was *behind*, still asking for stabs already taken. `hold` cleared only
on a frame under AIR (3.5% VWC). A probe pulled from a wet bag is itself wet
and reads well above that for a second or two, and at an 800 ms poll a quick
reference-to-mid-bag move can produce no qualifying frame at all. The
mid-bag stab then arrives while the machine is still in `hold`, where it is
dropped on the floor: no row, no cursor advance. Do that a few times in a
room and the last table is still asking for stops the operator finished.

Same root cause as 1 — the operator was moving faster than the machine could
see, and the colours were not telling him when to wait.

**Shipped.** `hold` also clears on a decisive drop from the value just
logged (HOLD_DROP 15 points). A paired mid-bag reading runs about five points
under its reference, so a 15-point drop cannot be mistaken for one and
cannot re-arm the machine while the probe is still in the bag — covered from
both sides in test/adda.js.

**Worth confirming in the field**: whether any rows went missing before the
fix. A room that would not finish will have fewer CSV rows than stabs taken.
